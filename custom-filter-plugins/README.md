## What Are Filter Plugins?
Filter plugins act like tools that shape data within your playbooks. They’re written in Python and allow you to define how data is processed, so you can use it exactly how you want in your tasks.

## Why Use Them?
With custom filters, you can validate data, format strings, or calculate values—ideal for fine-tuning your automations!

## Best Practices for Developing Filter Plugins

Meaningful Names: Always choose names that describe what your filter does, like format_date or sum_list.
Error Handling: Implement checks, like we did for the sum_list to ensure valid input.
Documentation: Include docstrings for each filter to guide future users.
